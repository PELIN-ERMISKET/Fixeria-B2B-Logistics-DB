# Fixeria B2B Logistics Platform â€” PostgreSQL Database

## Overview

**Fixeria** is a sample B2B logistics and transportation platform designed as a portfolio project for learning **intermediate-level SQL and database design**.

**Main idea:**  
Producers, logistics companies, or individuals can sign up on the website and submit transportation/storage service requests through a simple form.  
Registered logistics companies can receive these requests and reach out to the requester with offers.  
The platform generates revenue through monthly subscription plans for companies to list their services and get more leads.
